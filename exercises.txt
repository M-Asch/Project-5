Exercise 1: The red vertical bars denote differences within the regions of the DNA.
 The highlight gray regions represent nucleotides that could not be properly deciphered.

Exercise 2: Yes, the region between 2000 and 2990 because there are many,
 large differences within the DNA sequences at this location.

Exercise 3: The presumed original nucleotide at position 23063 is A. Of the 100 November 3 genomes,
 1 had the mutation. The mutation changes the nucelotide from A to T. Of the 100 December 8 genomes,
  44 had the mutation.

Exercise 4: TACATG

Exercise 5: The gap is a deletion mutation because a majority of the sequences from November 3 contain the
  sequence TACATG while a few of the other sequence are completely missing the sequence.

Exercise 6: The original nucleotide at this position is C. 99 of the 100 November 3 genomes contained
  the original C nucelotide. The mutation turned the C nucleotide to an A. 44 of the genomes from December 8
   picked up the mutation.

Exercise 7:
N501-Y 23063 [NOV3, DEC 8, DNOV 27 23063]    [DEC 5, NOV 10 23064 (23065)]
DELETION [NOV3, DEC 8 21765-21770], [NOV27 = 21763 (21764)] [NOV10, DEC 05 21769 (21770)],
P681-H: 23604 [NOV3, DEC 8, DNOV 27 23604] [DEC 5, NOV 10 23062 (23063)]

The mutation was from an C to an A. 44 of the DEC 8 genome had the mutation and 1 from the NOV 8 also had it.

Exercise 8: Interesting features resulting from the December 8 heat map can be seen in the bottom
  right corner of heat map with the many crosses and the large lines along the bottom and right sides
  of the map that approach the corner. These most likely represent differences within the different genome
  sequences. This differs from earlier heat maps as previous heat maps tended to express differences in the
  early parts of the sequence, as seen through the darker areas in the top right of these maps. From this,
  we can conclude that different areas of the genome would begin to see mutations the longer COVID was spreading
  within England.
